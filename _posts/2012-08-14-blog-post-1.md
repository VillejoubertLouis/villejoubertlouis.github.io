Cochlear implants are fascinating devices! Their magic lies in the ability to bypass the cells normally responsible for translating sound waves—purely physical phenomena—into electrical signals the brain can understand. These devices essentially replace the function of the tiny sensory cells in the inner ear, known as hair cells, which often degrade due to certain pathologies or simply as a result of aging.

At this point, you might assume that a cochlear implant user perceives the sound environment just like someone with normal hearing. You’re both right and wrong at the same time. In other words, we don’t fully understand everything yet! But let me try to explain why there’s such a gap in our knowledge. 

Let’s simulate what a cochlear implant user might actually hear!
